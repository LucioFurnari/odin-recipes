    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This strawberry pie is my favorite pie, and it's very easy to make. I got the recipe many years ago in North Jersey from the Sussex County Strawberry Farm. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1</strong> quart fresh strawberries, hulled </li>
        <li><strong>1 (9 inch)</strong> pie crust, baked</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> cup white sugar</li>
        <li><strong>3</strong> tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li><strong>3/4</strong> cup water</li>
        <li><strong>1/2</strong> cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Arrange 1/2 of strawberries in baked pastry shell. Place remaining strawberries in a medium saucepan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add sugar to the strawberries in the saucepan; place over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl. Gradually stir cornstarch mixture into boiling strawberry mixture. 
            Reduce heat and simmer mixture until thickened, about 10 minutes, stirring constantly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour cooked strawberry mixture over berries in pastry shell. Refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 3 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Before serving, whip cream in a medium bowl until soft peaks form. Serve each slice of pie with a dollop of whipped cream.

    </ol>
